COMPONENTS REQUIRED

Shakti processor development board (e.g., Vajra or Rise)
USB to UART converter (if not onboard)
LED (for output indication)
Resistor (220Ω for LED current limiting)
Potentiometer or sensor (to simulate process variable input)
Push button or switch (for manual/auto mode control)
Breadboard and jumper wires
Power supply (if not powered via USB)



CONNECTIONS

Connect LED anode to GPIO output pin of Shakti board (e.g., GPIO_0)
Connect LED cathode to one end of 220Ω resistor
Connect other end of resistor to GND
Connect potentiometer middle pin to ADC input pin (if available)
Connect potentiometer outer pins to VCC and GND
Connect switch between another GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO_1) and GND
Connect UART TX/RX lines between Shakti board and PC or USB-UART converter
Power the board via USB or external supply
